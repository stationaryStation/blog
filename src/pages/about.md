# Heya! I am Station

I am 15 year old bisexual furry. My favorite thing to do is draw and my second favorite thing to do is code.
I try to be myself at all times and I don't try to create bad, unreadable code (which I always do somehow).

I write code because I don't have a lot of things to do and my favorite programming language is <b><u>Typescript</u></b>
But one day I want to learn Java (But I don't understand OOP) or Rust.

## I work with:
- SolidJS
- ReactJS
- Next
- Neovim
- LibreSprite
- Penpot
- Krita
- Figma
- Astro

# The *why* of this blog

This blog is mainly a way to communicate about myself and what I do every week. And also because learning new
frameworks is really refreshing. This blog is made using Astro, a JavaScript framework which I have never used
in my life. This is truly my first time using Astro, and I am already enjoying it.
