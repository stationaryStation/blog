I've made the switch from Discord and Twitter to FOSS alternatives recently, and so far it has been going smoothly. On this post I am going to speak about my experience using those applications and how you can make the switch easily.

I've discovered Revolt.chat last week and decided to try it out since It looked promising. So I made an account and joined 'Revolt Lounge', the revolt testing server. I talked a bunch, made friends and even got a game for free (Thanks Veiled). Then while I was surfing through some bios I found a interesting social media called miruku.chat.

It's based on mastodon, which already is a fully free and open source software what is like twitter, but good. Everyone is nice to you there and there isn't any drama surrounding mastodon or miruku.
