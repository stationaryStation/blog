# Saving on time (Not related to daylight savings, btw)

I use my phone way more than I actually need, here is a screenshot of this week's screen time:

As you can see, I have used YouTube for a whopping 8 hours, and this week hasn't even ended yet.

And I have found that screen times actually help you regulate how you use your phone. So I have set up some limits to myself (That I can skip if I *really* need to)

So today I will be going through how to set screen time limits on your device and how I have them set up.

# Setting up Screen Times
## Android

On newer Android devices, go to Settings or Preferences, and open “Digital Wellbeing” or “Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls”. Then tap on “Screen Time goal” to set up a Global Screen Time limit, or tap on “App timers” to set a limit for a specific app.


# How I have them set up

I use my phone a lot when I am outside my house, so I think that 6 hours is more than enough for what I use it.

But I want to also balance how much I use a certain app, so I have a 2-hour limit on Reddit, YouTube, Revolt and Firefox/Chrome and a 1-hour limit for other apps I don't use a lot.

For Obsidian, I reserved 3 hours because I want to still write down articles on the go or just annotate something to a note.

# Should you use them?

No, not really. 

Unless you have some sort of addiction to a specific app, you don't really have to set limits on your phone.

But if that is the case, I recommend using a strict limit that you can follow without cheating every day because forcing yourself onto doing something is bad for your health.

I also recommend taking breaks from time to time so that you can relax and take in everything that you have done.

Lastly, here is a question for the readers, did you have any type of addiction to a certain app on your phone? If so, why and how did you overcome that yourself?
