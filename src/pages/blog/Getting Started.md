Hello and this is my first post!

I am not sure yet what I am going to post over here since this is my first time making a blog that I will actually update
from time to time.

The new blog runs Astro instead of Next.js, which was used on the [old blog](https://stationarystation.vercel.app/?rel=new)
since I want to actually write *markdown* instead of using a `.json` file with **all** the posts inside. Since this is the
first time using Astro, I won't use the ***fancy*** features that Astro has, and maybe, just maybe I will make this blog
look good, but since I am a complete newbie with css (And graphics design in general) I won't do anything that looks
breathtaking.

Developing sites has always been my passion over the years it's still the thing that motivates me every day. Motivation
is hard to find, and not much has happened this year (Aside of me coming out as "bisexual"). At least I have found many
proyects that I find cool and intresting like [Revolt.chat](https://rvlt.gg) and [the fediverse](https://miruku.cafe).

Also, this way of writing blogs is really cool because I don't have to worry about html tags and other caveats that frameworks
have!

I will work on moving my *really really old* posts from my old site and move them here, so that I can use the `stationarystation`
subdomain as my landing page for my proyects and social media.
